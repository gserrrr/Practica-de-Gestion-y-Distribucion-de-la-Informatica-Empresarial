Some chilies have 20, 40, 600-plus ingredients.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000 line:-3
This one has 10, 'cause 10 is all you need.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000 line:-3
INTRO: (SINGING) You suck at cooking, yeah, you totally suck.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000 line:-3
We're gonna turn the stovetop on medium high, get in

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000 line:-3
a teaspoon of oil, which isn't necessarily necessary.

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000 line:-3
Then throw in around 2 pounds of ground beef.

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000 line:-3
So we're gonna start by browning the beef.

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000 line:-3
Why?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000 line:-3
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

10
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000 line:-3
That's right.

11
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000 line:-3
Browning creates flavor.

12
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000 line:-3
Break it all up and let it sit for a couple minutes.

12
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000 line:-3
Once that starts to get nice and brown

13
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000 line:-3
on one side, we're gonna flip it, then let it sit again.

14
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000 line:-3
Flip it and sit it.

15
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000 line:-3
Just like you do when your dog's bad.

16
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000 line:-3
Just kidding, don't flip your dog.

17
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000 line:-3
After a couple minutes, you can play meat peek-a-boo, just to check and see -- yep.

18
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000 line:-3
That's browning, all right.

19
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000 line:-3
See, we're getting some nice, brown, crusty particles in there.

20
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000 line:-3
Gonna take a big, yellow onion.

21
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000 line:-3
Preferably the kind with garlic built in the middle.

22
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000 line:-3
And systematically demolish this into smithereens.

23
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000 line:-3
And then add more garlic.

24
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000 line:-3
Coat the bottom with a little bit of olive oil.

25
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000 line:-3
Throw in the smithereens.

26
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000 line:-3
We cook these until they just start to brown.

27
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000 line:-3
What I'm gonna do is add in a little more olive sauce.

28
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000 line:-3
We get both the built-in and independent garlic in there for just a couple minutes.

29
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000 line:-3
Now I'm going to spoon our brown beef into there.

30
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000 line:-3
You can add in 1 teaspoon of salt.

31
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000 line:-3
I'm just gonna break that beef up a little bit more.

32
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000 line:-3
I'm gonna take a can of crushed tomatoes.

33
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000 line:-3
If you can't find powerstone crushed tomatoes, you can

34
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34 line:-3
just give it a powerstone tap before you open it.

35
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000 line:-3
You can also play the washboard.

36
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000 line:-3
Now we'll just baptize that beef.

37
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000 line:-3
(echoes) I hereby consecrate you with the power of tomato.

38
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000 line:-3
You're probably gonna want to start turning that down

39
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000 line:-3
before you get chili lava all over the place.

40
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000 line:-3
Now I'm going to add 2 tablespoons of chili powder.

41
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000 line:-3
Keep in mind that any powder that you add to chili

42
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000 line:-3
automatically becomes chili powder.

43
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000 line:-3
This cumin, for example, which I'm adding a tablespoon of, is now chili powder.

44
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000 line:-3
Now I'll add in 1 cup of beef broth, because you want to create

45
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000 line:-3
the sense that cattle are charging at you from multiple directions.

46
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000 line:-3
Now I'll cover that and let it simmer on low.

47
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000 line:-3
There's a bit of a debate in the chili world

48
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000 line:-3
over whether or not you're supposed to include beans.

49
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000 line:-3
And I can honestly say after doing a lot of research on this, who gives a [BLEEP]?

50
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000 line:-3
If you like beans and chili, put beans and chili.

51
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000 line:-3
If you don't like beans and chili but you dislike someone

52
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000 line:-3
who also doesn't like beans and chili

53
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000 line:-3
more than you dislike beans and chili, put beans and chili.

54
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000 line:-3
So we'll open up a can of these chatty bastards.

55
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000 line:-3
(Laughs while talking) Wash off the bastard sauce. *chuckles*

56
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000 line:-3
Oh, no.

57
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000 line:-3
Did you see the rag touch that bean?

58
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000 line:-3
Ooh, guys, no.

59
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000 line:-3
Kill it with fire.

60
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000 line:-3
It's the right thing to do.

61
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000 line:-3
So that's sputtering like a dirty mass airflow sensor.

62
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000 line:-3
So we're just going to give that a bit of a wang jangle.

63
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51 line:-3
I'm gonna add in the old beans.

64
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000 line:-3
Oh, whoops, I forgot.

65
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000 line:-3
Half a tablespoon of brown sugar, 'cause we need as many brown things as possible.

66
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000 line:-3
We're gonna let this simmer for another half an hour to an hour.

67
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000 line:-3
Some people associate chili with toughness.

68
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000 line:-3
Like, you're a lumberjack or someone who chops trees down.

69
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000 line:-3
If you wanna sort of go down that toughness road, you can use a wang jangler

70
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000 line:-3
that's attached to a brick, also known as a brang jangler.

71
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000 line:-3
But if you're just a cool, laid-back dude with nothing to prove, you can

72
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000 line:-3
use a tiny whisk, also known as a tang wangler.

73
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000 line:-3
But if you're on a whole 'nother level of toughness, you can

74
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000 line:-3
use a steel mace wang jangler, also known as a stang mangler.

75
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000 line:-3
Additionally, you can also just add in no more than a single drop of tough sauce.

76
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000 line:-3
Ooh, let's be careful.

77
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000 line:-3
And we'll just wang tangle that up.

78

Who needs 'em? I do.

82
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000 line:-3
Shredded cheddar, sour cream, scallion, chopped tomato, cilantro,

83

tortilla chips, woodchips, everything in a special place forever.

84
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000 line:-3
It's like you're building the meal on top of the chili.

85
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000 line:-3
It's almost as if the chili becomes

86
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000 line:-3
the most flavorful rice you could ever possibly imagine.

87
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000 line:-3
That's a damn good chili.

88
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000 line:-3
Alternatively, instead of putting things on chili, you could

89
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000 line:-3
put chili on things, such as rice, a baked potato, or a hot dog.

90
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000 line:-3
And luckily, I've got my pal Binging with Babish here, who's gonna

91
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12 line:-3
show you how to make that hot dog.
